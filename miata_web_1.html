			<h2><center>Why should you buy a Mazda Miata?</center></h2>
			
				<p>January 17th, 2023</p><br>
					
			<p>
			When you hear someone talk about <a href="https://www.mazdausa.com/" target ="_blank">Mazda</a>, what do you usually think? Maybe the reliable and popular
			<a href ="https://www.caranddriver.com/mazda/cx-5" target="_blank">CX-5?</a> Or perhaps the modern and versatile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazdaspeed" 
			target="_blank">Mazda Speed</a>? Ask the general population, and these are usually something similar to the answers you'll recieve. Ask most car enthusiast, and 
			their answer will be the <strong>MX-5 Miata</strong>.<br>
			<br>Now, if you have a general understanding of iconic cars, and or have seen any of the Fast And Furious Movies, I know what you're thinking already. <i>What about the RX-7?</i>
			That's a good point, and one many would make. The RX series pionereed rotary engines, and were the first company to do so. But this isn't a documentary on the RX series, this is 
			a praise to the genius design and practically of the Mazda MX-5 Miata. 
			</p>
			
			<h3>A look back on the 90's, the MX-5s debut.</h3>
			
			<p>
			As we begin this anaylzation on one of the most iconic sport cars, there is no other place to start except looking at the father. That would be no other than the late Mazda design team 
			member, Shunji Tanaka. Tanaka was actually the chief designer on the production line in his time. He was tasked with building a design that used both American and Japanese idea's and motion, 
			and man did he deliver. "I thought of a wild animal when it's hunting, running fast and accurate, and for silence, the tranquility of nature. I wanted the car to melt into the scenery, reflecting 
			the light over its curved surfaces."<br>
			<br>A little too spiratual for me, but the Miata did indeed run accurate, cutting corners so fast there'd be no time for the light to reflect. More on this later, instead, 
			let's take a look at the history of the MX-5 Miata.

				<h4>Miata's first design, the NA.</h4>
				<figure>

				</figure>
				<br>
				
				<p class="d">
				The NA was the first design in the evolution of the Miata. While it was first, it's commonly argued amongst the car community that it is also the best. This isn't without reason though, and although the 
				Miata is still in production today, this first design had a few key differences. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>The popular and flippy, twentieth-century <i>hidden headlamps</i></li>
					<br><li>A 1.6 liter engine. Small, but reliable!</li>
					<br><li>Lightest Miata: The first NA only weighed 2,116 lbs!</li>
					<br><li>A 5-speed manual transmission or 4 speed auto, which carried on up until the NC.</li>
				
				</ul>
				<p class="d">	There's a few other differences here and there, but that about somes it up. (I own a 1990 MX-5 now!)</p>
				
				
				
				<h4>The NB</h4>
				<figure>
					<img src="imgs/nb_miata.jpg" alt="A factory green miata with a foresty backdrop">
					<figcaption>2001 NB Mazda MX-5</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<br>
				
				<p class="d">
				The next generation didn't come around until the late 90's, specifally, 1998. That's when the new and somewhat improved NB hit the production line. It officially hit US shores a year later in 1999 though. 
				And with it, a few underlooked adjustments and differences to it's predecessor. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>A new 1.8 liter engine, increasing from 115 horsepower to 140. A pretty noticeable difference for a small change.</li>
					<br><li>The removal of the hidden headlamps, most see this as a mistake.</li>
					<br><li>A weight increase to 2300 lbs, due to the larger frame and engine bay to suit the slightly bigger engine.</li>
					<br><li>A factory turbocharger, but only for the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_MX-5_(NB)"  target ="_blank">Miataspeed Miata</a> in 2004 and 2005.</li>
				</ul>
				
				
				<h4>The NC</h4>
				<figure>
					<img src="imgs/nc_miata.jpg" alt="A factory gray nc miata with a beach backdrop">
					<figcaption>2006 NC Mazda MX-5</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<br>
				<p class= "d">
				The Mazda Miata kept its winning streak going when making the NC generation starting in 2005, releasing the 2006 model. By this point, car enthusiast around the world started to realize that Miatas were here 
				to stay, and they were good at what they did. Featuring:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>An even stronger 2.0 liter 4 cylinder engine, producing 170 WHP and an impressive 140 lb torque.</li>
					<br><li>New and not particually well recieved, fender buldges.</li>
					<br><li>An increase of weight from 2300 lbs to 2500 lbs.</li>
					<br><li>A new 6-speed transmission, previously only 5 gears due to the lower power.</li>
					<br><li>A retractable hardtop, no more leaks for any new Miata owner.</li>
				</ul>
					<p class="d">It was also around this time that many Miata enthusiast were feeling as though Mazda was straying from the Miata's routes. This is mainly because of the constant jump in weight among the first few generations, 
					as well as the bulky look of the NC. <br>
					<br>But, just as Mazda took the car industry by storm in the 90's, the next generation would prove they still had it in them.</p>
			
				
				
				<h4>The ND (current)</h4>
				<figure>
					<img src="imgs/nd_miata.jpg" alt="A factory yellow nd miata with a beach backdrop">
					<figcaption>2018 ND Mazda MX-5</figcaption>
				<figure>
				<br>
				<p class = "d">The ND MX-5 is currently the most updated generation of Miata, as Mazda still has plans to continue the produtcion of the ND's until 2025. Mazda would somehow even outdo their 90's run in this generation, as the ND Mitata 
				hit the 1 million mark. Including but not limited to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A slighly lighter and less powerful engine, dropping down to 150 horsepower up until 2018. After 2018 the engine was revised to pull in 184 horse at the same engine weight.</li>
					<br><li>A lighter build at 2300 lbs, as some weight was cut down. <br>
					<br><li>A new retractable fastback version was released for a more sleek looking convertible style.</li>
				<br></ul>
				<p class="d">+ So much more with this model. The ND is truly a remarkable car with perfect review after perfect review. Some even saying it cures depression. Mental illness aside, the ND was a true return to form, both on the inside and 
					out. </p>

			<h2>Why you should buy a Mazda Miata.</h2>
			
			<p>
			Originally, I was going to go answer this question in the opening paragraph. But I came to the conclusion that the history and evolution of the Miata needs to be addressed first. Tanaka's dream for the Miata, the evoultion,
			the changes and benefits of each generation, hell even the images are needed to help you, the reader understand why this car is so great. If you happen to still be asking that question, then for one, I need to work on my developing skills.
			For two, let me just answer it simply in the case of that. Because they combine reliabilty, handling, precision, and enjoyability all into one small car.</p><br>
			
			<p><br>I won't delve too deep into the whole reliablilty thing, since well, if you like sport cars that's probably not your first thought. The Miata is a rear wheel drive car, quite different than the typical front wheel drive.
			You can get <a href="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pgoaty-miata-3-1608224636.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.175xh&resize=1200:*" target="_blank">sideways</a> in this <span class="curse">fu*$ing</span>
			thing if you're daring enough! Ever since the NA, the Miata has had some of this best brakes, handling, and precision. It's nature is to simply be fun to drive. I don't thinks there's any better way to describe it. For all you 
			technical geeks out there, I'll leave a few links to some reviews and such in case you can't take my word. 
			</p><br>
			
			
			<h3>A brief look at modifications and aftermarket support.</h3>
			
			<p>
			For the most part, that about sums up the answer to Why you should buy a Miata.However, what about the aftermarket support and modability? There's one more question that many car enthusiast will ask themselves before buying an old 90's sh%$box. <i>Can I mod this thing out?</i><br>
			
			<br> I can quite literally sum up that question with a single photo. If you want that, just click <a href= "https://www.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/25/2021/05/001-lm7-miata.jpg" target= "_blank">here</a>. In case you have no idea what you're looking at 
			in that photo, or you just want a yes or no, then yes. The Miata is probably one of the MOST modified cars in this day and age. There's so many different styles to go with. Wanna keep it stock on the exterior? Check out some factory or aftermarket OEM or OEM+ parts. Or maybe 
			you wanna make it go fast? Swap that engine or maybe even buy a turbo or supercharger kit.<br>

			<br>As the title says, this is just a breif look at the moding capabilities of the Miata, so I'll link a few of the many websites dedicated to selling OEM and aftermarket parts STRICTLY for Miatas.
